            Daca News was built on the idea of keeping Dreamers
            informed about DACA and current events.
        </p>
        <p class="m-4">
            DACA stands for the <span class="font-bold">Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals</span> program
            created by President Barack
            Obama, which has allowed nearly 800,000
            young people,
            known as "Dreamers," to avoid deportation and remain in the U.S.
        </p>
        <p class="m-4">
            With so much going on in the world right now, it's proving more difficult to keep up
            with breaking news and events on a daily basis. Even on its own, the DACA program and immigration
            reform is a highly debated topic and any new government policies can impact the program and
            its recipients.
        </p>
        <p class="m-4">
            For a DACA recipient, staying on top of news should be a top priority. Being informed earlier is
            better. I built this
            project to collect and store DACA related articles every day. There will be more changes coming
            soon, as I have yet to roll out new features!
